Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength:
Tools used: passwordmeter.com, bitwarden
These two tools help us in creating strong passwords.
A strong is the mandatory thing to keep our more secured 
most of the attackers try to hack the passwords to steal the data 
so when you maintain the password strongly and regular changing of passwords helps in protecting the data.
this passwordmeter helps in creating passwors
 
HOW TO MAKE A PASSWORD STRONGER:

Number of Characters
Uppercase Letters
Lowercase Letters
Numbers
Symbols
Middle Numbers or Symbols
Requirements
These makes the password more stronger
If we made these deductions we can make it even more stronger 
Letters Only
Numbers Only
Repeat Characters (Case Insensitive)
Consecutive Uppercase Letters
Consecutive Lowercase Letters
Consecutive Numbers
Sequential Letters (3+)
Sequential Numbers (3+)
Sequential Symbols (3+)
When we keep 12345678 as a password, it is easy to hack even though it contains 8 characters 
But when you add the @ symbol like 12345@6789 it is a good password, but when a hacker sits for 10 minutes, then he can hack it 
To this, if we add alphabets with upper case and lower case, it is stronger (A12345@6789yt)
 When we want to make it more stronger and dont want to hack by any attacker when you follow the above all the rules then you can make the strongest password .
NOTE: If an attacker tries to hack your password he will observes you like your phone number, name, date of birth and all 
And you check that in these 2 tools ( passwordmeter.com, bitwarden).

TYPES OF PASSWORD ATTACKS:
man-in-the-middle attacks: Network interception attacks capture passwords as they are transmitted over networks man-in-the-middle attacks, packet sniffing, and DNS spoofing).
Social engineering: Social engineering attacks manipulate human behavior and exploit users' weaknesses to obtain passwords.
BRUTE FORCE ATTACK: In cryptography, a brute-force attack involves systematically trying all possible combinations of characters to guess passwords, encryption keys, or other data. This method, also known as exhaustive key search, relies on the attacker's computational power to test each combination until the correct one is found. 
TYPES OF BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS:
Dictionary attacks : surmises usernames or passwords utilizing a dictionary of potential strings or phrases.
Rainbow table attacks - a rainbow table is a precomputed table for turning around cryptographic hash capacities. It very well may be utilized to figure a capacity up to a specific length comprising of a constrained arrangement of characters.
Reverse brute force attack - utilizes a typical password or assortment of passwords against numerous conceivable usernames. Focuses on a network of clients for which the attackers have recently acquired information.
Simple brute force attack - utilizes an efficient way to deal with 'surmise' that doesn't depend on outside rationale.
